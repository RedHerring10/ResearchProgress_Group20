Foundational Information:
  AI Systems pose a risk to:
    - a person's rights, liberties, safety, and economic opportunity
    - an organization's reputation 
    - The natural resources and environment of the planet 
    - Global financial system and supply chains

  AI risks or failures that aren't properly defined can be difficult to measure and may not be entirely conveyed
  For multiple reasons:
    - We don't know 100% how AI works
    - AI in a lab setting can work differently from AI in a real-world scenario 
    - The risks of AI change increase as it goes through different stages 
  Thus, it can be difficult to even define the level of risks of an AI quantitatively or qualitatively


AI Risks and Trustworthiness:
  Characteristics of AI trustworthiness:
    - Valid and reliable
    - Safe
    - Secure & Resilient
    - Explainable & Interpretable
    - Privacy Enhanced
    - Accountable & Transparent
    - Fair with Harmful Bias Managed

AI RMF Core
  Govern - A culture of risk management is cultivated and present
    Map - Context is recognized, and risks related to context are identified
    Measure - Identified risks are assessed, analyzed, or tracked
    Manage - Risks are prioritized and acted upon based on a projected impact
