Google's AI approach is grounded in 3 principles:

  Bold Innovation:
    They want AI research to be allowed to grow in order to make breakthroughs in biology, medicine, physics, and mathematics, with a focus on solving real-world problems

  Responsible development and deployment:
    The negatives of AI should not be developed with more negatives than positives. At its worst, it should be a 0-sum game. Human oversight, due diligence, and feedback mechanisms should be implemented

  Collaborative progress, together:
    AI should be made for individual and collective benefit. AI should be developed as a foundational technology for driving creativity, productivity, and innovation


Pros:
  A very idealistic start to a framework, outlines 3 pillars that we should try to achieve in our own framework

Cons:
  No hard set of rules or enforcement built in. If Google were to break its principles, no one would have any reason and/or means to punish Google
  For our framework, we should add deterrents to our policy.
