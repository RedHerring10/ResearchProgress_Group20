# The document this is describing was made in 2023 when Joe Biden was president, so the information is likely outdated in terms to current US AI adoption strategies 

This document primarily focuses on AI's use in the Military

Focuses on what they call the Agile Approach:
  A positive feedback loop of user Feedback, Experimentation, and Deployment
  It's meant to provide results as fast as possible with no safeguards beyond user Feedback 

Supports loose regulations for the purpose of maintaining U.S. military superiority 

Within their AI Hierarchy of Needs:
  1st Need: Quality Data
  2nd Need: Insightful Analytics & Metrics
  3rd Need: Responsible AI (Kind of a self-report that creating responsible AI is the least of DoD's AI concerns)
