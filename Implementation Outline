// Thank you, Puya, for the outline

Input:
AI policy documents, official frameworks (EU AI Act, NIST RMF), and any related datasets from Kaggle.

Step 1 â€“ Data Gathering
  Collect datasets and policy documents from official sources. (my dataset's suggestion: link)
  Clean and preprocess data (remove unnecessary columns).
  Select at least three key entities for comparison, such as:  
    ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º European Union â€“ EU AI Act
    ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ United States â€“ NIST AI Risk Management Framework
    Corporate â€“ OpenAI or Google AI Governance Principles

Step 2 â€“ Policy Analysis Module (Python + Google Colab)
  Write a simple Python module to analyze datasets and generate statistical comparisons.
  Visualize findings using diagrams and charts (e.g., bar graphs showing regulatory strictness, coverage of ethical vs. security principles).
  Design a comparative table with columns such as:
    Policy Name / Entity
    Focus Area (Ethical / Security / Governance)
    Risk Rating or Regulation Level
    Mechanisms for Enforcement
    Relevance to Cybersecurity

Step 3 â€“ Comparative Analysis
  Analyze similarities and differences between the selected policies.
    Example: The EU AI Act emphasizes strict legal enforcement, while the NIST RMF focuses on voluntary guidelines.
  Evaluate which policy dimensions contribute most to cybersecurity and risk mitigation for AGI or LLM-based systems.

Step 4 â€“ Results and Recommendations
  Present diagrams, tables, and key comparison results.
  Conclude the best combination of policies for responsible AI adoption.
  Propose a simple mini-framework called Cybersecurity-Aware Responsible AI Adoption Framework (CARA-AI), highlighting the recommended balance between innovation and regulation.

Final Project Output (Paper)
  A comparative table summarizing findings.
  A short analytical report (4â€“6 pages) including diagrams, discussion, and policy recommendations.
