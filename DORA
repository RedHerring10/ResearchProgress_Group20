EU Regulation
Applicable to all EU member states, specifically to banks, insurers, investment firms, payment institutions, crypto-asset service providers and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) 3rd party providers.
The national competent authorities, or NCA, and European Supervisory Authorities (ESA) oversee the compliance.

Applies to AI: AI systems part of the ICT infrastructure must be covered by risk management, testing, and incident reporting.
- AI seervice providers can be considered critical 3rd party providers, which brings them to EU oversight.
- As a concept, if AI is part of the ICT infrastructure, it needs to hold the same resilience requirements.

ICT Risk Management (Articles 5-15)
- Entities must establish and maintain an ICT RMF
- Requires governance, protection, detection, response, recovery and learning in said plan
- Boards of directors are accountable for ICT risk oversight (important)

ICT Incident Reporting (16-23)
- Entities must classify incidents related to ICT and be able to report major incidents to regulators
- Must have standardized templates and timelines for initial, intermediate and final reports
- Main concept is that they must improve supervisory awareness and resilience on the sector

Digital Operational Resilience Testing (24-27)
- Required to conduct regular testing of their ICT systems
- Larger, critical institutions must perform threat-led pentesting (TLPT) every 3 years
- Tests need to cover critical functions and any 3rd party dependencies

ICT 3rd party Risk (28-44)
- Required to manage risks from ICT service providers like cloud or AI services
- Critical ICT providers are subjected to direct EU oversight by the ESAs
- Contracts must reflect requirements and contain clauses on security, access, audit and termination

Information Sharing (45-47)
- Entities may exchange cyber threat intelligence and information
- Sharing must respect confidentiality and competition laws
- Main concept is to build a collective defense against cyber threats

Penalties
- No fixed fines like EU AI Act or GDPR
- Member States set penalties under their national law
- Penalties are calculated to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive
- Can include remedial measures, fines and restrictions

Concepts:
Risk management: Documented frameworks, board accountability, lifecycle security.
Incident reporting: Classification, standardized reporting, regulator notification.
Testing: Regular resilience testing, TLPT for critical entities.
Thirdâ€‘party risk: Contractual clauses, oversight of critical ICT providers, exit strategies.
Information sharing: Voluntary but encouraged; structured exchange of threat intelligence.
